# Directions for Homework 4:
1. Create a new respository that houses all of your homework from previous lessons. There MUST be folders named “Homework1”, “Homework2", “Homework3”, “Homework4"
2. For this week’s homework, we are going to be using the random joke api (https://official-joke-api.appspot.com) there are two parts.
    - The first task is to “fix” the [file](hello.html) included. There will be no directions for this other than to fix the [file](hello.html). The best hint is that there should be no lines that are completely deleted from the [file](hello.html). The endproduct is that there should be a some text, with the joke on the page, surrounding by a blue bordered box. Commit this code, and make a pull request.
    - The next task is to get at least **3** sets of jokes and their answers, and make a matching game. One set of jokes should be put onto one side of the page and its corresponding set of answers should be put on another (Hint: Use onclick and css to achieve this). Commit this code and **add** on to the pull request, **DO NOT MAKE A NEW ONE**.

**IN BOTH TASKS**, please mention [me](https://github.com/gescalona1) or [lucas](https://github.com/LucasStettner) (@ us in the pull request) that you achieved it, otherwise we won’t consider. Your previous homework and this one should be in another branch that is not master. (Please also use descriptive descriptions. If they are not, the likelihood of our accepting some description of “aa” or “b” is very low).

If you have questions, slack please.
